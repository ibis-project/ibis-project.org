Comparison to other tools Why not use pandas ? pandas is great for many use cases. But pandas loads the data into the memory of the local host, and performs the computations on it. Ibis instead, leaves the data in its storage, and performs the computations there. This means that even if your data is distributed, or it requires GPU accelarated speed, Ibis code will be able to benefit from your storage capabilities. Why not use SQL? SQL is widely used and very convenient when writing simple queries. But as the complexity of operations grow, SQL can become very difficult to deal with. With Ibis, you can take fully advantage of software engineering techniques to keep your code readable and maintainable, while writing very complex analytics code. Why not use SQLAlchemy ? SQLAlchemy is very convenient as an ORM (Object Relational Mapper), providing a Python interface to SQL databases. Ibis uses SQLAlchemy internally, but aims to provide a friendlier syntax for analytics code. And Ibis is also not limited to SQL databases, but also can connect to distributed platforms and in-memory representations. Why not use Dask ? Dask provides advanced parallelism, and can distribute pandas jobs. Ibis can process data in a similar way, but for a different number of backends. For example, given a Spark cluster, Ibis allows to perform analytics using it, with a familiar Python syntax. Ibis supports Dask as a backend.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#main-features","text":"Ibis provides a standard way to write analytics code, that then can be run in multiple engines.

Info As of 2022-01-05 there is experimental support for Python 3.10. However, there are a number of problems with dependencies and development tools that ibis uses and we cannot offically support Python 3.10 until those are fixed. Nix (Linux, Python 3.7-3.9) Miniconda (Linux, Mac, Windows, Python 3.7-3.9) Download and install nix Install gh : nix-shell -p gh # or nix-env -iA gh Fork and clone the ibis repository: # you will likely need to auth, gh will guide you through the steps gh repo fork --clone --remote ibis-project/ibis Run nix-shell in the checkout directory: cd ibis # set up the cache to avoid building everything from scratch nix-shell -p cachix --run 'cachix use ibis' # start a nix-shell # # this may take awhile to download artifacts from the cache nix-shell Download and install Miniconda Install gh conda install -c conda-forge gh Fork and clone the ibis repository: gh repo fork --clone --remote ibis-project/ibis Create a Conda environment from a lock file in the repo: cd ibis conda create -n ibis-dev -f conda-lock/<platform-64-pyver>.lock Activate the environment conda activate ibis-dev Install your local copy of ibis into the Conda environment. In the root of the project run: pip install -e . General workflow Find an issue to work on All contributions are welcome! Code, docs, and constructive feedback are all great contributions to the project. If you don't have a particular issue in mind head over to the GitHub issue tracker for Ibis and look for open issues with the label good first issue . Feel free to help with other issues that aren't labeled as such, but they may be more challenging. Once you find an issue you want to work on, write a comment with the text /take on the issue. GitHub will then assign the issue to you. This lets people know you're working on the issue. If you find an issue that has an assignee, comment on the issue and ask whether the assignee is still working on the issue. Make a branch The first thing you want to do is make a branch. Let's call it useful-bugfix : git checkout -b useful-bugfix Make the desired change Let's say you've made a change to ibis/expr/types.py to fix a bug reported in issue #424242 (not actually an issue). Running git status should give output similar to this: $ git status On branch useful-bugfix Your branch is up to date with 'origin/useful-bugfix' . Changes not staged for commit: ( use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed ) ( use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory ) modified: ibis/expr/types.py no changes added to commit ( use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\" ) Run the test suite Next, you'll want to run a subset of the test suite. Dependencies Required nix environment or conda environment To run a subset of the ibis tests use the following command: PYTEST_BACKENDS = \"sqlite pandas\" pytest ibis/tests ibis/backends/tests You can change PYTEST_BACKENDS=\"sqlite pandas\" to include one or more space-separated supported backends that you want to test. It isn't necessary to provide PYTEST_BACKENDS at all, but it's useful for exercising more of the library's test suite. Commit your changes Dependencies Required git cz Tip cz is already installed in your environment if you followed the setup instructions Next, you'll want to commit your changes. Ibis's commit message structure follows semantic-release conventions . Warning It isn't necessary to use cz commit to make commits, but it is necessary to follow the instructions outlined in this table in this table . Stage your changes and run cz commit : $ git add . $ cz commit You should see a series of prompts about actions to take next: Select the type of change you're committing.

What is the scope of this change? (class or file name): (press [enter] to skip) This is optional, but if there's a clear component or single file that is modified you should put it. In our case, let's assume the bug fixed a type inference problem, so we'd type in type-inference at this prompt. You'll then be asked to type in a short description of the change which will be the commit message title: ? Write a short and imperative summary of the code changes: (lower case and no period) fix a type inference issue where floats were incorrectly cast to ints Let's say there was a problem with spurious casting of float to integers, so we type in the message above. That number on the left (here (69) ) is the length of description you've typed in. Next you'll be asked for a longer description, which is entirely optional unless the change is a breaking change , or you feel like a bit of prose ? Provide additional contextual information about the code changes: (press [enter] to skip) A bug was triggered by some incorrect code that caused floats to be incorrectly cast to integers. For non breaking changes, this isn't strictly necessary but it can be very helpful when a change is large, obscure, or complex. For this example let's just reiterate most of what the commit title says. Next you're asked about breaking changes: ? Is this a BREAKING CHANGE? Correlates with MAJOR in SemVer (y/N) If you answer y , then you'll get an additional prompt asking you to describe the breaking changes. This description will ultimately make its way into the user-facing release notes. If there aren't any breaking changes, press enter. Let's say this bug fix does not introduce a breaking change.

Updating dependencies Automatic dependency updates WhiteSource Renovate will run at some cadence (outside of traditional business hours) and submit PRs that update dependencies. These upgrades use a conservative update strategy, which is currently to increase the upper bound of a dependency's range. The PRs it generates will regenerate a number of other files so that in most cases contributors do not have to remember to generate and commit these files. Manually updating dependencies Danger Do not manually edit setup.py , it is automatically generated from pyproject.toml Edit pyproject.toml as needed. Run poetry update Run # if using nix $ ./dev/poetry2setup -o setup.py # it not using nix, requires installation of tomli and poetry-core $ PYTHONHASHSEED = 42 python ./dev/poetry2setup.py -o setup.py from the repository root. Updates of minor and patch versions of dependencies are handled automatically by renovate . Releasing Style and formatting The following tools are run in both CI and pre-commit checks to ensure codebase hygiene: Tool Purpose black Formatting Python code isort Formatting and sorting import statements flake8 Linting Python code nix-linter Linting nix files nixpkgs-fmt Formatting nix files shellcheck Linting shell scripts shfmt Formatting shell scripts pyupgrade Ensuring the latest available Python syntax is used Tip If you use nix-shell all of these are setup for you and ready to use, you don't need to install any of these tools. We use numpydoc as our standard format for docstrings. Commit philosophy We aim to make our individual commits small and tightly focused on the feature they are implementing or bug being fixed. If you find yourself making functional changes to different areas of the codebase, we prefer you break up your changes into separate Pull Requests. In general, a philosophy of one Github Issue per Pull Request is a good rule of thumb. Maintainer's guide Maintainers should be performing a minimum number of tasks, deferring to automation as much as possible: Reviewing pull requests Merging pull requests A number of tasks that are typically associated with maintenance are partially or fully automated: Updating library dependencies: this is handled automatically by WhiteSource Renovate Updating github-actions: this is handled automatically by WhiteSource Renovate Updating nix dependencies: this is a job run at a regular cadence to update nix dependencies Occasionally you may need to manually lock poetry dependencies, which can be done by running poetry update --lock If a dependency was updated, you'll see changes to poetry.lock in the current directory. Merging PRs PRs can be merged using the gh command line tool or with the GitHub web UI. Release PyPI Releases to PyPI are handled automatically using a Python implementation of semantic release .

The former Client subclasses have been replaced by a Backend class that must subclass ibis.backends.base.BaseBackend . The BaseBackend class contains abstract methods for the minimum subset of methods that backends must implement, and their signatures have been standardized across backends. The Ibis compiler has been refactored, and backends don't need to implement all compiler classes anymore if the default works for them. Only a subclass of ibis.backends.base.sql.compiler.Compiler is now required. Backends now need to register themselves as entry points.

As several correctness bugs with the SQL compiler were fixed, we recommend that all users upgrade from earlier versions of Ibis. New Features Initial PostgreSQL backend contributed by Phillip Cloud. Add groupby as an alias for group_by to table expressions Bug Fixes Fix an expression error when filtering based on a new field Fix Impala\\'s SQL compilation of using OR with compound filters Various fixes with the having(...) function in grouped table expressions Fix CTE ( WITH ) extraction inside UNION ALL expressions. Fix ImportError on Python 2 when mock library not installed API Changes The deprecated ibis.impala_connect and ibis.make_client APIs have been removed 0.7 (2016-03-16) This release brings initial Kudu-Impala integration and improved Impala and SQLite support, along with several critical bug fixes. New Features Apache Kudu (incubating) integration for Impala users. See the blog post for now. Will add some documentation here when possible. Add use_https option to ibis.hdfs_connect for WebHDFS connections in secure (Kerberized) clusters without SSL enabled. Correctly compile aggregate expressions involving multiple subqueries. To explain this last point in more detail, suppose you had: table = ibis . table ([( 'flag' , 'string' ), ( 'value' , 'double' )], 'tbl' ) flagged = table [ table . flag == '1' ] unflagged = table [ table . flag == '0' ] fv = flagged . value uv = unflagged . value expr = ( fv . mean () / fv . sum ()) - ( uv . mean () / uv . sum ()) The last expression now generates the correct Impala or SQLite SQL: SELECT t0 . ` tmp ` - t1 . ` tmp ` AS ` tmp ` FROM ( SELECT avg ( ` value ` ) / sum ( ` value ` ) AS ` tmp ` FROM tbl WHERE ` flag ` = '1' ) t0 CROSS JOIN ( SELECT avg ( ` value ` ) / sum ( ` value ` ) AS ` tmp ` FROM tbl WHERE ` flag ` = '0' ) t1 Bug Fixes CHAR(n) and VARCHAR(n) Impala types now correctly map to Ibis string expressions Fix inappropriate projection-join-filter expression rewrites resulting in incorrect generated SQL. ImpalaClient.create_table correctly passes STORED AS PARQUET for format='parquet' . Fixed several issues with Ibis dependencies (impyla, thriftpy, sasl, thrift_sasl), especially for secure clusters. Upgrading will pull in these new dependencies. Do not fail in ibis.impala.connect when trying to create the temporary Ibis database if no HDFS connection passed. Fix join predicate evaluation bug when column names overlap with table attributes. Fix handling of fully-materialized joins (aka select * joins) in SQLAlchemy / SQLite.

See the new Ibis for Impala Users guide for more on using Ibis with Impala. The Ibis for SQL Programmers guide also was written since the 0.5 release. This release also includes bug fixes affecting generated SQL correctness. All users should upgrade as soon as possible. New Features New integrated Impala functionality. See Ibis for Impala Users for more details on these things. Improved Impala-pandas integration. Create tables or insert into existing tables from pandas DataFrame objects. Partitioned table metadata management API. Add, drop, alter, and insert into table partitions. Add is_partitioned property to ImpalaTable . Added support for LOAD DATA DDL using the load_data function, also supporting partitioned tables. Modify table metadata (location, format, SerDe properties etc.) using ImpalaTable.alter Interrupting Impala expression execution with Control-C will attempt to cancel the running query with the server. Set the compression codec (e.g. snappy) used with ImpalaClient.set_compression_codec . Get and set query options for a client session with ImpalaClient.get_options and ImpalaClient.set_options . Add ImpalaTable.metadata method that parses the output of the DESCRIBE FORMATTED DDL to simplify table metadata inspection. Add ImpalaTable.stats and ImpalaTable.column_stats to see computed table and partition statistics. Add CHAR and VARCHAR handling Add refresh , invalidate_metadata DDL options and add incremental option to compute_stats for COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS . Add substitute method for performing multiple value substitutions in an array or scalar expression. Division is by default true division like Python 3 for all numeric data. This means for SQL systems that use C-style division semantics, the appropriate CAST will be automatically inserted in the generated SQL. Easier joins on tables with overlapping column names. See Ibis for SQL Programmers . Expressions like string_expr[:3] now work as expected. Add coalesce instance method to all value expressions. Passing limit=None to the execute method on expressions disables any default row limits. API Changes ImpalaTable.rename no longer mutates the calling table expression.

Add remaining string functions supported by Impala. Add pipe method to tables (hat-tip to the pandas dev team). Add mutate convenience method to tables. Fleshed out WebHDFS implementations: get/put directories, move files, etc. See the full HDFS API . Add truncate method for timestamp values ImpalaClient can execute scalar expressions not involving any table. Can also create internal Impala tables with a specific HDFS path. Make Ibis\\'s temporary Impala database and HDFS paths configurable (see ibis.options ). Add truncate_table function to client (if the user\\'s Impala cluster supports it). Python 2.6 compatibility Enable Ibis to execute concurrent queries in multithreaded applications (earlier versions were not thread-safe). Test data load script in scripts/load_test_data.py Add an internal operation type signature API to enhance developer productivity.

Add CHAR and VARCHAR handling Add refresh , invalidate_metadata DDL options and add incremental option to compute_stats for COMPUTE INCREMENTAL STATS . Add substitute method for performing multiple value substitutions in an array or scalar expression. Division is by default true division like Python 3 for all numeric data. This means for SQL systems that use C-style division semantics, the appropriate CAST will be automatically inserted in the generated SQL. Easier joins on tables with overlapping column names. See Ibis for SQL Programmers . Expressions like string_expr[:3] now work as expected. Add coalesce instance method to all value expressions. Passing limit=None to the execute method on expressions disables any default row limits.","title":"New Features"},{"location":"release_notes/#api-changes_4","text":"ImpalaTable.rename no longer mutates the calling table expression.","title":"API Changes"},{"location":"release_notes/#contributors_3","text":"$ git log v0.5.0..v0.6.0 --pretty=format:%aN | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn 46 Wes McKinney 3 Uri Laserson 1 Phillip Cloud 1 mariusvniekerk 1 Kristopher Overholt","title":"Contributors"},{"location":"release_notes/#05-2015-09-10","text":"Highlights in this release are the SQLite, Python 3, Impala UDA support, and an asynchronous execution API.

Long Term Goals This section outlines broader, longer-term goals for the project alongside a few short-term goals and provides information and direction for a few key areas of focus over the next 1-2 years, possibly longer depending on the amount of time the developers of Ibis can devote to the project. Compiler Structure Separation of Concerns The current architecture of the ibis compiler has a few key problems that need to be addressed to ensure longevity and maintainability of the project going forward. The main structural problem is that there isn\u2019t one place where expression optimizations and transformations happen. Sometimes optimizations occur as an expression is being built, and other times they occur on a whole expression. The solution is to separate the expression construction and optimization into two phases, and guarantee that a constructed expression, if compiled without optimization, maps clearly to SQL constructs. The optimization pass would happen just before compilation and would be free to optimize whole expression trees. This approach lets us optimize queries piece by piece, as opposed to having to provide all optimization implementations in a single pull request. Unifying Table and Column Compilation Right now, it is very difficult to customize the way the operations underlying table expressions are compiled. The logic to compile them is hard-coded in each backend (or the compiler\u2019s parent class). This needs to be addressed, if only to ease the burden of implementing the UNNEST operation and make the codebase easier to understand and maintain. Depth \"Depth\" goals relate to enhancing Ibis to provide better support for backend-specific functionality. Backend-Specific Operations As the number of ibis users and use cases grows there will be an increasing need for individual backends to support more exotic operations. Many SQL databases have features that are unique only to themselves and often this is why people will choose that technology over another. Ibis should support an API that reflects the backend that underlies an expression and expose the functionality of that specific backend. A concrete example of this is the FARM_FINGERPRINT function in BigQuery. It is unlikely that the main ValueExpr API will ever grow such a method, but a BigQuery user shouldn\u2019t be restricted to using only the methods this API provides. Moreover, users should be able to bring their own methods to this API without having to consult the ibis developers and without the addition of such operations polluting the namespace of the main API. One drawback to enabling this is that it provides an incentive for people to define operations with a backend-specific spelling (presumably in the name of expediency) that may actually be easily generalizable to or useful for other backends. This behavior should be discouraged to the extent possible. Standardize UDFs (User Defined Functions) A few backends have support for UDFs. Impala, Pandas and BigQuery all have at least some level of support for user-defined functions. This mechanism should be extended to other backends where possible. We outline different approaches to adding UDFs to the backends that are well-supported but currently do not have a UDF implementation. Development of a standard interface for UDFs is ideal, so that it\u2019s easy for new backends to implement the interface. Breadth The major breadth-related question ibis is facing is how to grow the number of backends in ibis in a scalable, minimum-maintenance way is an open question. Currently there is a test suite that runs across all backends that xfails tests when a backend doesn\u2019t implement a particular operation. At minimum we need a way to display which backends implement which operations. With the ability to provide custom operations we also need a way to display the custom operations that each backend provides. Backend-Specific Goals These goals relate to specific backends pandas Speed up grouped, rolling, and simple aggregations using numba pandas aggregations are quite slow relative to an equivalent numba implementation, for various reasons. Since ibis hides the implementation details of a particular expression we can experiment with using different aggregation implementations. Dask Implement a Dask backend There is currently no way in ibis to easily parallelize a computation on a single machine, let alone distribute a computation across machines. Dask provides APIs for doing such things. Spark Implement a SparkSQL backend SparkSQL provides a way to execute distributed SQL queries similar to other backends supported by ibis such as Impala and BigQuery.","title":"Roadmap"},{"location":"about/roadmap/#roadmap","text":"This document is an outline of the next set of major efforts within ibis.","title":"Roadmap"},{"location":"about/roadmap/#long-term-goals","text":"This section outlines broader, longer-term goals for the project alongside a few short-term goals and provides information and direction for a few key areas of focus over the next 1-2 years, possibly longer depending on the amount of time the developers of Ibis can devote to the project.","title":"Long Term Goals"},{"location":"about/roadmap/#compiler-structure","text":"","title":"Compiler Structure"},{"location":"about/roadmap/#separation-of-concerns","text":"The current architecture of the ibis compiler has a few key problems that need to be addressed to ensure longevity and maintainability of the project going forward.

This needs to be addressed, if only to ease the burden of implementing the UNNEST operation and make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.","title":"Unifying Table and Column Compilation"},{"location":"about/roadmap/#depth","text":"\"Depth\" goals relate to enhancing Ibis to provide better support for backend-specific functionality.","title":"Depth"},{"location":"about/roadmap/#backend-specific-operations","text":"As the number of ibis users and use cases grows there will be an increasing need for individual backends to support more exotic operations. Many SQL databases have features that are unique only to themselves and often this is why people will choose that technology over another. Ibis should support an API that reflects the backend that underlies an expression and expose the functionality of that specific backend. A concrete example of this is the FARM_FINGERPRINT function in BigQuery. It is unlikely that the main ValueExpr API will ever grow such a method, but a BigQuery user shouldn\u2019t be restricted to using only the methods this API provides. Moreover, users should be able to bring their own methods to this API without having to consult the ibis developers and without the addition of such operations polluting the namespace of the main API. One drawback to enabling this is that it provides an incentive for people to define operations with a backend-specific spelling (presumably in the name of expediency) that may actually be easily generalizable to or useful for other backends. This behavior should be discouraged to the extent possible.","title":"Backend-Specific Operations"},{"location":"about/roadmap/#standardize-udfs-user-defined-functions","text":"A few backends have support for UDFs. Impala, Pandas and BigQuery all have at least some level of support for user-defined functions. This mechanism should be extended to other backends where possible. We outline different approaches to adding UDFs to the backends that are well-supported but currently do not have a UDF implementation. Development of a standard interface for UDFs is ideal, so that it\u2019s easy for new backends to implement the interface.","title":"Standardize UDFs (User Defined Functions)"},{"location":"about/roadmap/#breadth","text":"The major breadth-related question ibis is facing is how to grow the number of backends in ibis in a scalable, minimum-maintenance way is an open question.

At minimum we need a way to display which backends implement which operations.
